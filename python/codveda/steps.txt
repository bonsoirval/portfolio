Step 1: Inspect the dataset

I’ll take a quick look at the structure of /mnt/data/4_house_prediction_dataset.csv (columns, sample rows, datatypes).

It looks like the dataset was read incorrectly — everything is jammed into a single column.
This usually happens when the file is space-separated instead of comma-separated.

Step 2: Reload with correct delimiter

We’ll try using whitespace separation. 

Perfect ✅ — now the dataset is properly structured:

505 rows × 14 columns

This looks like the Boston Housing dataset, commonly used for price prediction.

Step 3: Business Data Analyst Problem Definitions

As a business data analyst, the goal is not just prediction, but to derive insights for decision-making.
Here are some problem definitions we can solve with this dataset:

Problem 1: What factors drive house prices?

Business View: Understand which features (crime rate, number of rooms, accessibility, etc.) influence home values.

Solution: Correlation analysis + feature importance.

Problem 2: Which neighborhoods have undervalued or overvalued homes?

Business View: Identify areas where houses may be cheaper than expected, useful for investors.

Solution: Grouping by neighborhood variables and comparing price distributions.

Problem 3: Predict house prices for new properties.

Business View: Help real estate companies or buyers estimate fair prices.

Solution: Build a regression model (Linear Regression, Random Forest).

Problem 4: How does pollution, crime, or access to transport affect house values?

Business View: Guide city planning and policy-making.

Solution: Regression and visualization of relationships.
