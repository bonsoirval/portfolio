Got it 👍 You’ve uploaded a Sentiment dataset now. Since you asked for working code to solve business problems using Python data analytics with comments, let’s structure it as a Business Data Analyst Walkthrough.

We’ll do the following:

Load & inspect dataset

Define business problems (related to customer sentiment)

Provide Python solutions with comments

Step 1: Inspect dataset first

I’ll check the structure of your /mnt/data/3) Sentiment dataset.csv so we can understand what’s inside.

Great ✅ The dataset is now clear:

732 rows × 15 columns

Key fields:

Text → post content

Sentiment → Positive / Negative / Neutral

Platform, Country, Hashtags

Engagement metrics: Retweets, Likes

Time features: Year, Month, Day, Hour

📊 Business Problems & Python Solutions (with comments)
Problem 1: Which platforms drive the most positive engagement?

Business View: Marketing team wants to know where to focus (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.).

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Group by platform and sentiment
platform_sentiment = df_sentiment.groupby(["Platform","Sentiment"]).size().unstack()

# Plot sentiment distribution per platform
platform_sentiment.plot(kind="bar", figsize=(8,5))
plt.title("Sentiment Distribution per Platform")
plt.ylabel("Number of Posts")
plt.show()


✅ Helps managers decide which platform performs best for positive brand engagement.

Problem 2: Which countries show the highest positive vs negative sentiment?

Business View: Useful for targeting advertising campaigns by geography.

# Count sentiment per country
country_sentiment = df_sentiment.groupby(["Country","Sentiment"]).size().unstack().fillna(0)

# Plot
country_sentiment.plot(kind="bar", stacked=True, figsize=(10,6))
plt.title("Sentiment by Country")
plt.ylabel("Number of Posts")
plt.show()


✅ Reveals countries with most positivity or negativity → helps tailor marketing strategy.

Problem 3: What time of day drives most engagement (likes & retweets)?

Business View: Marketing wants to post when engagement is highest.

# Average engagement by posting hour
engagement_by_hour = df_sentiment.groupby("Hour")[["Likes","Retweets"]].mean()

# Plot likes vs retweets by hour
engagement_by_hour.plot(kind="line", figsize=(10,5), marker="o")
plt.title("Average Engagement by Hour of Day")
plt.ylabel("Engagement (Likes & Retweets)")
plt.xlabel("Hour of Day")
plt.show()


✅ Helps schedule posts at high-engagement hours.

Problem 4: Which hashtags drive the most engagement?

Business View: Social media team wants to know effective hashtags.

from collections import Counter

# Flatten hashtags into a list
all_hashtags = []
for tags in df_sentiment["Hashtags"]:
    for tag in str(tags).split():
        all_hashtags.append(tag.strip())

# Count top hashtags
hashtag_counts = Counter(all_hashtags).most_common(10)

# Convert to DataFrame for plotting
df_tags = pd.DataFrame(hashtag_counts, columns=["Hashtag","Count"])

# Plot
sns.barplot(x="Count", y="Hashtag", data=df_tags, palette="viridis")
plt.title("Top 10 Hashtags")
plt.show()


✅ Shows top-performing hashtags to maximize reach.

Problem 5: Which sentiment generates higher engagement?

Business View: Do positive, negative, or neutral posts drive more likes/retweets?

# Average engagement by sentiment
sentiment_engagement = df_sentiment.groupby("Sentiment")[["Likes","Retweets"]].mean()

# Plot
sentiment_engagement.plot(kind="bar", figsize=(7,5))
plt.title("Average Engagement per Sentiment")
plt.ylabel("Engagement (Likes & Retweets)")
plt.show()


✅ Helps decide whether positive messaging or addressing complaints works better.

🔑 Business Insights We Can Expect

Best Platforms: Identify which social platform has most positivity.

Geographic Strategy: Target countries with positive sentiment, address negatives.

Posting Time: Optimal posting hours for engagement.

Hashtag Strategy: Focus on top-performing hashtags.

Message Tone: Check if positive posts get more engagement than negative/neutral.

👉 Do you want me to bundle all these problems + solutions into one clean Python script (like a ready-to-run notebook with sections) so you can use it directly?

Perfect 👌 Now we’ll take your Sentiment dataset and solve business problems using K-Means clustering (an unsupervised ML technique).

The business idea here is:

Group social media posts into clusters (based on engagement and sentiment-related features) to discover hidden patterns — like high-engagement vs low-engagement posts, or topic-based grouping.

🏷️ Walkthrough: K-Means Clustering for Business Insights
Step 1: Import libraries & load dataset
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Load dataset
file_path = "/mnt/data/3) Sentiment dataset.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Inspect first rows
print(df.head())

Step 2: Define business problem features

We’ll cluster posts based on engagement (Likes, Retweets) and optionally Sentiment.

# Select numeric features relevant for clustering
features = df[["Likes","Retweets"]].copy()

# Scale data (K-Means is distance-based → scaling needed)
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(features)

Step 3: Find optimal number of clusters (Elbow Method)
# Try different cluster numbers
wcss = []  # within-cluster sum of squares

for i in range(1, 11):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=i, random_state=42, n_init=10)
    kmeans.fit(scaled_features)
    wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)

# Plot elbow curve
plt.plot(range(1,11), wcss, marker="o")
plt.title("Elbow Method for Optimal k")
plt.xlabel("Number of Clusters")
plt.ylabel("WCSS")
plt.show()


✅ Choose the “elbow point” (where curve bends) as best k.

Step 4: Apply K-Means clustering
# Let’s assume k=3 based on elbow method
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42, n_init=10)
df["Cluster"] = kmeans.fit_predict(scaled_features)

# Inspect cluster assignments
print(df[["Likes","Retweets","Cluster"]].head())

Step 5: Visualize Clusters
# Scatter plot of engagement clusters
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.scatterplot(
    x="Likes", y="Retweets", 
    hue="Cluster", data=df, 
    palette="Set2", s=80
)
plt.title("K-Means Clusters of Engagement")
plt.show()


✅ We expect clusters like:

Cluster 0: Low likes + low retweets (low engagement)

Cluster 1: Medium engagement

Cluster 2: Viral posts (high likes & retweets)

Step 6: Business Insights from Clusters
# Analyze average metrics per cluster
cluster_summary = df.groupby("Cluster")[["Likes","Retweets"]].mean()
print(cluster_summary)

# Check sentiment distribution in each cluster
sentiment_cluster = df.groupby(["Cluster","Sentiment"]).size().unstack().fillna(0)
print(sentiment_cluster)


✅ Example insights:

Cluster 2 (High Engagement) may have mostly Positive sentiment posts → brand should push positivity.

Cluster 0 (Low Engagement) may be dominated by Neutral posts → need better messaging.

Can recommend optimal content types to marketing.

🔑 Business Analyst Takeaways

High engagement cluster = viral posts → replicate strategy.

Low engagement cluster = underperforming posts → avoid or improve.

Sentiment mix per cluster → check if positive posts are really driving engagement.

Country/platform segmentation inside clusters → refine strategy by geography & channel.

👉 Would you like me to extend this clustering beyond Likes/Retweets to include text features (e.g., sentiment encoded, hashtags, platform) so clusters represent types of posts (content + engagement) rather than just engagement?
