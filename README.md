## *Projects Process*
- Data Cleaning
With mysql server (from mariadb 11.8.3) and mysql workbench (version 8.0.36) installed on Debian 13 (Trixie) the dataset was accessed 
from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set).
The dataset was imported directly into mysql using mysql workbench and it automatically created a table, picking datatype from the content
of the columns. The mysql directory contains the following files
- instructions.txt : this contains the instruction / requirements needed to successfully complete the project, stated [here](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/sql-projects/), 
where the project idea was picked.
- objectives.txt : the objectives of this project. 
- data_cleaning_rough_work.sql : where the actually data cleaning was carried, random codes in the project
- data_cleaning.sql : the final sql used in the project, standardized and arranged in the order they were carried out
- dataset : directory containing the dataset used in the project.

- Data Analysis (coming soon)
