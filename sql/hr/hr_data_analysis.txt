Great ‚Äî your dataset has 311 employees and 36 columns with HR-related details (salary, performance, recruitment source, department, termination, demographics, etc.).

To perform Human Resources SQL analytics to attract employment, here‚Äôs what you should do:

üîπ 1. Define Your HR Analytics Goals

Since your aim is to attract more employment (talent acquisition), focus on:

Best recruitment sources (where successful employees come from).

Demographics & diversity insights (gender, race, citizenship, state).

Employee retention patterns (who stays vs who leaves).

Performance & satisfaction drivers.

üîπ 2. Prepare the Data for SQL

You‚Äôll need to clean and structure the data:

Convert dates (DOB, DateofHire, DateofTermination) into SQL DATE.

Ensure categorical columns (Sex, RaceDesc, RecruitmentSource, Department) are normalized.

Create derived columns, e.g.:

Tenure = DateofTermination - DateofHire

Age = CurrentDate - DOB

üîπ 3. SQL Queries for HR Insights

Here are examples of SQL queries you can run:

a) Top Recruitment Sources for Successful Hires
SELECT RecruitmentSource, COUNT(*) AS Hires, 
       AVG(EmpSatisfaction) AS AvgSatisfaction, 
       AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary
FROM HRDataset
WHERE Termd = 0
GROUP BY RecruitmentSource
ORDER BY Hires DESC;

b) Employee Retention by Department
SELECT Department, 
       COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Termd = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Terminated,
       ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN Termd = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*),2) AS TurnoverRate
FROM HRDataset
GROUP BY Department
ORDER BY TurnoverRate ASC;

c) Demographic Breakdown of Workforce
SELECT Sex, RaceDesc, COUNT(*) AS Employees
FROM HRDataset
WHERE Termd = 0
GROUP BY Sex, RaceDesc
ORDER BY Employees DESC;

d) Performance vs Recruitment Source
SELECT RecruitmentSource, PerformanceScore, COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM HRDataset
GROUP BY RecruitmentSource, PerformanceScore
ORDER BY Count DESC;

e) Absenteeism Patterns
SELECT Department, AVG(Absences) AS AvgAbsences
FROM HRDataset
GROUP BY Department
ORDER BY AvgAbsences DESC;

üîπ 4. Insights You Can Draw

Which recruitment channels yield the best performers and lowest turnover.

Which departments struggle with high attrition or absenteeism.

Employee satisfaction trends across demographics.

Optimal salary ranges that attract and retain talent.

üëâ Next step: I can generate ready-to-use SQL scripts for talent attraction dashboards (retention, recruitment source effectiveness, diversity hiring).

Would you like me to design a SQL HR analytics dashboard schema (tables + KPIs) so you can plug queries into a BI tool? 












#########################
Perfect üëç
I‚Äôll give you ready-to-use SQL scripts that you can run to build a Talent Attraction Dashboard. Then, I‚Äôll also outline a dashboard schema with KPIs that you can use in a BI tool like Power BI, Tableau, or even directly in SQL Server Reporting Services.

üîπ 1. SQL Scripts for HR Talent Attraction Analytics
A) Employee Retention (by Department & Overall)
-- Retention Rate per Department
SELECT Department,
       COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Termd = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ActiveEmployees,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Termd = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS TerminatedEmployees,
       ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN Termd = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*),2) AS RetentionRate
FROM HRDataset
GROUP BY Department
ORDER BY RetentionRate DESC;

B) Recruitment Source Effectiveness
-- Recruitment Sources ranked by retention & satisfaction
SELECT RecruitmentSource,
       COUNT(*) AS TotalHires,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Termd = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ActiveEmployees,
       ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN Termd = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*),2) AS RetentionRate,
       ROUND(AVG(EmpSatisfaction),2) AS AvgSatisfaction,
       ROUND(AVG(Salary),2) AS AvgSalary
FROM HRDataset
GROUP BY RecruitmentSource
ORDER BY RetentionRate DESC, AvgSatisfaction DESC;

C) Diversity Hiring Insights
-- Workforce Diversity (Gender x Race)
SELECT Sex,
       RaceDesc,
       COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount,
       ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM HRDataset WHERE Termd = 0),2) AS WorkforcePercentage
FROM HRDataset
WHERE Termd = 0
GROUP BY Sex, RaceDesc
ORDER BY EmployeeCount DESC;

D) High Performers by Recruitment Source
-- Which recruitment sources bring in high performers
SELECT RecruitmentSource,
       PerformanceScore,
       COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM HRDataset
WHERE Termd = 0
GROUP BY RecruitmentSource, PerformanceScore
ORDER BY EmployeeCount DESC;

E) Absenteeism & Engagement
-- Absences by Department (to see engagement levels)
SELECT Department,
       ROUND(AVG(Absences),2) AS AvgAbsences,
       ROUND(AVG(EngagementSurvey),2) AS AvgEngagement
FROM HRDataset
WHERE Termd = 0
GROUP BY Department
ORDER BY AvgAbsences DESC;

üîπ 2. Dashboard Schema & KPIs

You can structure the Talent Attraction Dashboard with the following:

Tables:

Employee Table: demographics, position, salary, hire/termination dates.

Recruitment Table: recruitment source, hire outcomes.

Performance Table: performance score, engagement, satisfaction.

Absenteeism Table: days late, absences.

KPIs:

Retention Rate = Active Employees √∑ Total Employees.

Turnover Rate = Terminated √∑ Total Employees.

Top Recruitment Sources = Sources with highest retention + satisfaction.

Diversity Ratio = % Female/Male, % Race distribution.

Employee Engagement Index = Avg(EngagementSurvey + EmpSatisfaction).

Absenteeism Rate = Avg(Absences) per department.

High Performer Source Ratio = % of hires with top performance score.

‚ö° With these SQL scripts + KPIs, you can build visuals like:

Retention Funnel (by dept & recruitment source)

Diversity Pie Charts (race & gender)

Engagement Heatmaps (department vs engagement/absences)

Recruitment Source Leaderboard
