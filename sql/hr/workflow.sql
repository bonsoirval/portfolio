-- Best recruitment sources (where successful employees come from).

-- Employee retention patterns (who stays vs who leaves).
-- Performance & satisfaction drivers.

	-- 2. Standardize data

	-- E) Absenteeism & Engagement
	-- Absences by Department (to see engagement levels)
	/* from the result, sales officers are most absent, this could be taken given they could have to go and meet clients without reporting 
	to the office. This is followed by IT/IS who could work remotely too, executive officers, could attend off office meeting with other 
	stake holders followed by admin officers and least software engineering. 

	Expectation is that admin officers would be least absent because they would report daily to the office to check and keep things in order
	while software engineers  can also work remotely.*/
