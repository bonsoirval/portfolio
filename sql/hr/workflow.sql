/* 1. Define Your HR Analytics Goals */
-- Focusing on:
-- Best recruitment sources (where successful employees come from).
-- Demographics & diversity insights (gender, race, citizenship, state).
-- Employee retention patterns (who stays vs who leaves).
-- Performance & satisfaction drivers.

/* 2. Prepare the Data for SQL */
-- Data cleaning:
/* 1. Clean Data */ 
	-- 0. Copy table 
    -- 1. Remove duplicates
	-- 2. Standardize data
	-- 3. Remove null values
    -- 4. Drop columns or rows

-- 
-- 0. Copy table - avoiding working with original dataset
	CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hr_stage0 AS SELECT * FROM hr;
    
-- 1. Remove duplicates
	-- a. Check if duplicate values exist
    -- no duplicates found : count of empid existing equals count of distinct empid
    SELECT COUNT(empid) FROM hr_stage0;
	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT empid) FROM hr_stage0;
    
-- 2. Standardize data
	desc hr_stage0; -- shows column names and datatypes are of good standard
    -- notice: Upper camel casing was used
    -- Employee_Name and LastPerformanceReview_Date do not conform to the upper camel casing naming. 
    -- Converting all to all lower and words separated by underscore

-- work in progress    
    
-- Convert dates (DOB, DateofHire, DateofTermination) into SQL DATE.
--  Ensuring categorical columns (Sex, RaceDesc, RecruitmentSource, Department) are normalized.
-- Create derived columns, e.g.:
-- Tenure = DateofTermination - DateofHire
-- Age = CurrentDate - DOB

-- 3. SQL Queries for HR Insights
/* 4. Insights You Can Draw */
-- Which recruitment channels yield the best performers and lowest turnover.
-- Which departments struggle with high attrition or absenteeism.
-- Employee satisfaction trends across demographics.
-- Optimal salary ranges that attract and retain talent.
